Fault slip is a frictional phenomenon where sliding is regulated by frictional properties of the surfaces and slip is resisted by frictional forces between the juxtaposing fault surfaces. Understanding the frictional behavior of rocks, and describing it in physics-based constitutive equations, is necessary to constrain the mechanics of seismic and aseismic fault slip and to advance dynamic rupture models that inform seismic hazard and risk assessments. Direct testing of constitutive relations, however, remains challenging as conditions in the Earthâ€™s crust are difficult to replicate in the lab. My work explores physical processes that contribute to slow and fast earthquakes, fault restrengthening or healing after earthquakes, and the role of heterogeneity on earthquake processes.

        <p>Thermal Pressurization</p>
        <p>Pore fluids are present along most faults in nature. At sliding rates above 1 mm/s, frictional heat causes thermal expansion of pore fluids which reduces the normal stress on the fault in a process called thermal pore fluid pressurization, or thermal pressurization. As friction is the ratio of shear stress to normal stress, this ultimately weakens the fault and is considered an important mechanism during earthquake nucleation and propagation. However, thermal pressurization may be inhibited when fault roughness is high, as new pore space opens with slip. If enough new pore spaces are opened, pore volume increases due to thermal pressurization can be fully accommodated and the fault can be strengthened in a process called dilatancy hardening. Thermal pressurization may also be inhibited when gouge, a natural wear product of fault slip, is present. A clearer understanding on when and how thermal pressurization may contribute to earthquakes in nature will ultimately inform physics-based dynamic rupture simulations.</p>
        <p>To explore the competition between thermal pressurization and dilatancy hardening, collaborators and I have conducted experiments at Brown University using the Tullis Rotary Shear Apparatus on flat and rough sliding surfaces to determine conditions in which thermal pressurization is suppressed. For rough surfaces, weakening (highlighted by green bars in the image to the left) occurs only 50% of the velocity steps we performed, and after 4x the slip required for weakening on flat faults (supported by NSF EAR award 2052897, PI Barbery).</p>
        <p>We have also recently embarked on a second investigation into thermal pressurization for gouge lined laboratory faults to understand if and when gouge suppresses thermal pressurization (supported by NSF EAR award 2338973, PI Barbery).</p>
