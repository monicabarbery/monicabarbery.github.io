My research focuses on earthquake and fault mechanics, rock friction, and brittle deformation of geologic materials using laboratory experiments, microstructural analysis, mechanical models, and field work. I investigate processes occuring from the nanoscale up to the kilometer scale at timescales of microseconds to decades to better understand the physics of earthquake nucleation, propagation, cessation, and healing.
