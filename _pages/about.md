<br><br>My research focuses on fault and earthquake mechanics, rock friction, and brittle deformation using laboratory experiments, microstructural analysis, mechanical models, and field work. I investigate processes occurring from the nanoscale up to the kilometer scale over timescales of microseconds to decades to better understand the physics of earthquake nucleation, propagation, cessation, and healing.
