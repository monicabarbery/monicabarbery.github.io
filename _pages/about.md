<br><br>I'm a research scientist working in the Experimental Rock Deformation Lab at Brown University. I investigate crustal deformation processes with a strong focus on earthquakes and rock friction. My research focuses on characterizing rheological and frictional properties of fault zone materials to advance our understanding of fault deformation processes and the earthquake cycle in continental and subducting fault zones. I combine rock deformation experiments with microstructural analysis and structural petrology, numerical modelling, and field work to explore earthquakes and faulting processes that occur from nanoseconds to decades and from the nanometer to the kilometer scale.
