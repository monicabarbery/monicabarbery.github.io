DEEPS REU
------ 
Since 2019, the Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences (DEEPS) has provided 9-week long Research Experience for Undergraduates summer internships supported by the National Science Foundation and in partnership with the Leadership Alliance at Brown University. This program provides hand-on research experience and mentorship for undergraduate students and particularly encourages students from historically underrepresented groups to apply. During the summer of 2024, I mentored an undergraduate student working in the Brown Rock Deformation Lab and also served as a discussion leader and early-career mentor to the full cohort of 9 undergraduate researchers working in DEEPS.

DEEPS CORES
------ 
For many years, DEEPS has partnered with the Providence Public School District (PPSD) to develop multi-lesson Earth Science modules for local elementary schools and high schools. In 2021, this partnership led to the development of DEEPS CORES (Career Opportunities and Research in Earth Sciences). This program continues focusing on the development of Earth Science modules for high school classrooms in addition to facilitating access to summer programs at Brown and research opportunities in DEEPS for PPSD students. Since 2022, I have participated in the development of curricula for DEEPS CORES and have helped to teach lessons at Hope High School.
